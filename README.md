# iPhone Media Organizer Tool

**A very handy tool to separate same-named JPG, HEIC, and MOV files.**

This tool helps you **organize photos and videos copied from an iPhone** in a simple and safe way.  
If you have copied all your photos from an Apple iPhone and now see the **same photos with different file types** (JPG, HEIC, MOV), this tool is for you.

Many iPhone photos come with **Live Photo videos (MOV files)** that can make folders messy and confusing.  
This small and handy tool helps you **separate or remove Live Photos**, keep only what you need, and **organize everything cleanly**.

Your media stays neat, easy to manage, and easy to restore(however it was just after copying from iphone) anytime.

## Features

- Move **MOV files** that have the same name as JPG files into a dedicated folder (`temporary MOV`).  
- Move **HEIC files** that have the same name as JPG/JPEG files into a dedicated folder (`temporary HEIC`).  
- Separate **MOV and HEIC files** with the same names to avoid clutter.  
- **Restore files** safely back to their original folders using log files.  
- **Dry run mode** to check what will happen without making changes.  
- **Handles duplicates safely**, automatically renaming files if needed.  
- **GUI interface** for easy one-click operations.  
- **Progress bar and status log** to track operations in real time.  
- Fully interactive — no hardcoded paths required.
